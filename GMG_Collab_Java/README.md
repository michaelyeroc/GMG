Java Game Development
=====================

## Getting Started

There is no engine like Unity available for Java
game development so we will be using other available
libraries to develop games in Java.

**While you are free to try using any available library
out there for those who haven't tried Java game development
yet we recommend using the libraries mentioned in this document.**

### 2D Gaming Development

The current library that will be used is Mini2Dx.
You can download the latest Mini2Dx project generator
from https://mini2dx.org/.

You can also find more information for Mini2Dx at
https://github.com/mini2Dx/mini2Dx/wiki.

### 3D Gaming Development

We have not yet started working on 3D game development
yet but the current library up for consideration is **libGDX**.

## Intellij and Eclipse IDE

It is recommended to use Intellij or Eclipse
IDE for ease of development but it is not required.

If you do not have Intellij you can go to
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
and download the IDE executable to install it on your
machine.

If you do not have Eclipse you can go to
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
and download the IDe executable to install it on your
machine.

## Mini2Dx

To download Mini2Dx project generator go to
https://mini2dx.org and navigate to the download
page. Once you download the project generator
for your system and extract the files you are
ready to create a new project.
