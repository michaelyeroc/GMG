Java Game Development
=====================

## Getting Started

There is no engine like Unity available for Java
game development so we will be using other available
libraries to develop games in Java.

**While you are free to try using any available library
out there for those who haven't tried Java game development
yet we recommend using the libraries mentioned in this document.**

### 2D Gaming Development

Current library that will be used is Mini2Dx.
You can download the latest Mini2Dx project generator
from https://mini2dx.org/.

### 3D Gaming Development

We have not yet started working on 3D game development
yet but the current library up for consideration is **libGDX**.

## Intellij IDE

If you don't have Intellij you can go to
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
and download the IDE exacutable to install it on your
machine.
