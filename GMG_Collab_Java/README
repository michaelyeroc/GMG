Java Game Development
=====================

## Getting Started

There is no engine like Unity available for Java
game development so we will be using other available
libraries to develop games in Java.

**While you are free to try using any available library
out there for those who haven't tried Java game development
yet we recommend using the libraries mentioned in this document.**

### 2D Gaming Development

For 2D development the *Slick2D* library offers an easy integration
for simple 2D games coded in Java and will be the main starting
library for game development.

### 3D Gaming Development

We have not yet started working on 3D game development
yet but the current library up for consideration is *libGDX*.
